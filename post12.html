        <h2>Pet Assist</h2>
        <h4>Spring 2025</h4>
        <h4>Figma, Adobe Illustrator</h4>
        <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Create a concept for a mobile app that can help with a wealth equity problem in some way with 3-4 different functions.</p>
        <p><strong>Process:</strong> To start this project, our instructor had us write on post-it notes various examples of equity problems and groups affected. After this excersize I took photos of some of the ideas that caught my interest to get my brain rolling on ideas with lead me to think about how wealth issues plays into equity and access to different services. This then lead to me thinking about how that could affect access to pet care, which then began my research into the topic. Research involved looking at the various statistics around low income pet owners such as access to insurance, and how often they saw a vet. The research went into my wireframes where I decided to develop for tasks for the project: creating a pet profile, setting alarms for times to administer care assuming the pet owner is busy with work, a filter system for finiding a vet at your incom level, and lastly a way to directly contact an animal science or or vet with an imediate health question.</p>
        <h4>Wireframes</h4>

        <img src="petassist/TaskFlow4.png" alt="taskflow4">
        </div>
        </section>
        
        <p>After the wireframes were developed we went through a round of user testing, where the app got feedback for the ideas which was mostly received postitively and as wells as for how the tasks flowed. In the shift from wireframes to the 1st draft of low fidelity prototypes, we did another round of testing, from which I got feedback to adjust things such as text hierearchy, adjusting the size of the buttons and adjusting colors to make elements more visible. I implemented this feedback into fininshing the prototypes. I also made graphics for the task complete screens of the tasks</p>

        
        <p>Since I only had half the functions made from wireframs to their prototype phase during the first round of testing, I decided to do another round, even though I already did the required amount for the project. The feedback incuded more size adjustments between text and elements as well as adding an option for undoing inputs and a search bar for the find vets page, all of these were considered and or implemented in the last draft for our presentation.</p>

        <p>This project was the first time I ended up designing a mobile app, despite having previous experience with figma. I learned alot about the process of making an app from research to the actual designing, as well as how to implement other skills and softwar like adobe illustrator.</p>
