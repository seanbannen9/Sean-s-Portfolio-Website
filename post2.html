        <h4>Wire and Wood</h4>
        <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Create a functional mechanical toy inspired by the works of Alexander Calder using only wire and wood.</p>
        <p><strong>Process:</strong> As this was the first time I was working with wire, I had no idea how to bring my idea of a Rock 'em Sock 'em robots style dueling game to life. This resulted in me consulting with my teacher a lot, which led me to researching an adjacent type of physical art called wirligigs. After watching a ton of videos to figure out how they work and how they can be made, I was able to figure out the concept for how the toy would work.</p>

        <p>Figuring out how to make the concept work was difficult. Eventually, after taking the advice of my professor, I looked into wooden mechanisms called whirligigs that gave me inspiration for the function of my toy. Figuring out how to translate that into wire was difficult, and as I worked on making the figures and mechanisms for the project, I had to engage in physics knowledge and consult with my professor in order to get the mechanism right.</p>

         <p>Once the mechanism was properly constructed and bolted onto the board. I added some finished visual touches and the project was complete with the action function working properly!</p>
