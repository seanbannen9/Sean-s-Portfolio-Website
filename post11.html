        <h2>Knight's Brew Coffee</h2>
        <h4>Winter 2024</h4>
        <h4>Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop</h4>
        <p><strong>This project was completed in partnership with Amy Ayala-Gallardo as a part of the pixal pals program</strong> </p>
        <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> create branding for either a coffee or boba shop of our own design, with a style guide(s), and mock ups of merchandise</p>
        <p><strong>Process:</strong> At the start of our project me and my partner and mentor assigned for the project Amy started sketching out a vairety of ideas, we started by sketching concepts for both a boba and coffee shop, before deciding to further develop our concepts for coffee. (Below are the sketches I personally made)</p>

        <p>Once I had a few concepts for coffee shop logos I liked I made a few concept logos in Adobe Illustrator, out the logos I worked on I was most invested in the development of the logo with a knight helmet, which was inspired by my roomate showing me coffee art during my sketching process. I even had a name in mind already called knights brew</p>

        <p>Once time came to choose a logo, me and my partner decided to move forward with the Kinghts Brew concept becuase it was the one we both enjoyed the most. We then decided that I will work on the style guide, featuring two alternate color schemes, and the she would make the merchandise mock ups using templates for photoshop.</p>
