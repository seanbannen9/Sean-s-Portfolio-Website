        <h4>Fall 2023</h4>
        <h4>Rhino 3D</h4>
        <p><strong>Challenge </strong> The goal of the project was to create a spinning top in Rhino 3d that can spin at least two rotations and 3d print it through Shapeways.</p>
        <p><strong>Process:</strong>After sketching some ideas out, I decided to further develop what I thought were the 3 strongest concepts from the first page. After my ideas were approved, I decided to use the top concept of the second page as the basis for my design, since I thought it would make for a fun and unique design compared to a more traditional top.</p>

        </section>
        <p>For the first iteration of my spinning top, I decided to print it myself to see how it spins. It was unable to spin due to the distribution of weight.</p>

        </section>
        <p>To address the issues for the final print, I added more to the back to achieve a better balance and rounded out the bottom tip. With these changes, the final print made by Shape Ways was able to make more than two rotations, meeting the goal set by the project.</p>

 <p>After the class was completed, I decided to adjust the model further using my own 3d printers to make it spin even better than it did in class. After consulting with several colleagues  with physics backgrounds, I arrived at this design, which, when printed, spun much better than the previous itereations</p>
