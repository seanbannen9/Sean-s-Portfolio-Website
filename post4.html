        <h2>Kazuki Takahashi Memorial</h2>
        <h4>Fall 2023</h4>
        <h4>Adobe Photoshop</h4>
        <p><strong>Artwork present in compositions was made by Kazuki Takahashi and etc, I had no hand in making them.</strong> </p>
        <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Create a poster that memorializes a deceased artist or designer to honor their work.</p>
        <p><strong>Process:</strong> This was my introduction to Photoshop’s photo editing capabilities. I decided to focus on composition and used basic tools to change the properties of the images I was using, such as deleting the backgrounds. One issue I had was finding a way to integrate elements of the card game Takahashi helped conceived which I decided to resolve by featuring the creatures form the card game coming out of the main character of the manga he created, since the image I used for the main character ended up serving as the base for my composition.</p>
